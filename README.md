# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-ML

This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences using machine learning techniques. It aims to personalize the movie-watching experience by leveraging user data, movie metadata, and collaborative behaviour patterns.

Features : 
**Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends movies similar to those the user liked, using features like genres, directors, cast, etc.

**Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests movies based on preferences of similar users by analyzing user-item interaction.

**Hybrid Model (Optional)** – Combines both filtering techniques for better performance.

**Evaluation Metrics** – Includes precision, recall, RMSE, and cosine similarity for performance evaluation.

**Interactive Interface** – Accepts user input (e.g., favorite movies) to provide personalized recommendations.

Tech Stack : 

Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
Scikit-Learn – Machine learning models
Surprise / LightFM / TensorFlow (optional) – Advanced recommendation algorithms
Flask – Web application framework
Jupyter Notebook – Prototyping and experimentation

Dataset : 
Desired or the dataset you acquired.

Steps to Run : 

Clone the repository:
git clone:  https://github.com/Vamsi-BJE/Movie-Recommendation-System-using-ML

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Flask application:
python app.py


Model Evaluation :
**Accuracy**: Achieves over 80% accuracy on test data

Dynamic updates based on user input : 
Uses similarity metrics or matrix factorization techniques like SVD, NMF

Future Improvements : 
Add deep learning with embeddings (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch)
Create a modern frontend using React or Vue
Support additional languages and metadata sources
